## Programming basics

Python, C++, Perl, Java, or BASIC is a high-level computer programming language, computer only accepts a very low-level language, machine language (represented in binaries). For a high-level language to be able to be run into the machine language the computer can execute, you can either compile or interpret the language.

A compiler is a complex computer program that takes another program written in a high level language and translates it into an equivalent program in the machine language of some computer.

An interpreter is a program that simulates a computer that understands a high-level language.
